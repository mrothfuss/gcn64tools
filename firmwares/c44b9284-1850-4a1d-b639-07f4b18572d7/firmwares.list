version=1.0.3
date=2023-03-17
notes=An attempt to support the Kramer Striker Wireless Controller:\n - Due to limitations of the current adapter design, this is not perfect.\n - The guitar may not work reliably and support is not guaranteed.\n - Poll interval _must_ be set to 5ms. Other values result in missed and/or ghost events.\n - Sometimes the Strum bar is not detected. (disconnect and reconnect the adapter in such cases)\n - Regardless of settings, button ID 15 sometimes toggles. This can be ignored, as button 15 does not physically exist on the guitar anyway.\n - Button assignments are: Orange=1, Blue=2, Red=3, Yellow=4, Start=5, Select=6, Tilt=8, Green=10, Strum up=13, Strum down=14

version=1.0.2
date=2022-05-31
notes=- Add support for the PSX Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110).\n  Should also work for the Dual Analog Controller.\n- Add support for the Playstation mouse (SCPH-1030)\n- Use slower timing when poll interval is >= 10ms.\n  This may improve 3rd party controller compatibility.
